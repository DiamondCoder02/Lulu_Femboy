## A bit of explanation

I recently got the idea how and where I want this project to continue. Due to uni and to finalize everything, it will take time. Luckly many things won't change, but this project will get weird and different soon.

Bot will have names and I wanna give them a nice personality.

<u>The website, nsfw will be the most effected. I might split the bot into two, but that means...</u>

1. one part of the bot will be sfw only, while having all the features.
2. second bot will have mostly nsfw. A lot of nsfw :3

Nsfw bot can be found here: [Femboy_UwU nsfw](https://github.com/DiamondPRO02/Femboy_UwU)

As a special feature if both bot is in one server, the two bot might talk with each other, but I will see how hard would it be to implement it.

The bot is early in development. Feel free to contribute if you want. I also appriciate every problem report and every help. This bot only works with slash commands.
