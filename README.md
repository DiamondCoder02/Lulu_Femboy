## Introduction

Hi, this is Lulu! A multi pupose femboy discord bot.

This is still early in development and as I'm working alone on this and doing university, this will stay as a hobby project for some time.

This is the wholesome part of a bot family. An nsfw version called Lily can be found here: [Lily_Femboy nsfw](https://github.com/DiamondCoder02/Lily_Femboy).

## Development

### Packages and APIs

As this was wrintten in Node.js 10.2.1

- <https://www.npmjs.com/>
- [Astrology free API - astrology](https://ohmanda.com/api/horoscope)
- [Dad Joke API - dad_joke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/)
- [Waifu.pics - waifu_pics](https://waifu.pics/)
- Also big thanks for Github Copilot. :3

### .env file

- TOKEN=  // Your bot token
- CID=  // Your bot client id
- ClientSecret=  // Your bot client secret
- botOwnerId=  // Your discord id ( owner of the bot )
- GID=  // Your guild id where you want to locally test the bot
- debug_level=  // Debug level you want the logging to be at

So your .env file should look like this:

```env
TOKEN=assdasdasdasdasd123123123123
CID=123456789
ClientSecret=asdasd123456789
botOwnerId=987654321
GID=123123123
debug_level=3
```

### Debug levels

(*-1 will disappear all logging.*)

0. Only errors.
1. Console.warn and line (line is not shown in log file)
2. Console.info
3. Console.log (Default)
4. Console.debug
5. (Enable shard logs, but probably spam the console/logs)

console.log("foo"); // Logged to console & saved in log file

console.debug("foo"); // Won't log to console, but will be saved

#### Personal Notes

- .env only gives back string.
- Drink wine and listen to music, to boost morale, motivational and productivity.
- Never stay with parents more than a week. It's harder to work.
