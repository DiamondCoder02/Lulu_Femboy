# From my discord notes:
Task sheet: __***Do not delete!***__

__**Idea:**__
- Webpage to edit config
- Server side language
- Bot voting?
- More event listeners
- Reminders
- Google search (chrome tabs)
- In interactionCreate also get other options for console log
- API and RSS testing?
- Voice record command?
- Math solver?

__**To fix:**__
- Check if a file or link got deleted
- Nhentai fix

__**Reminder:**__
- Write comments in code at some places
- Find alternate for nsfw nekos.life
- Do I want to complicate with message check for bot ping?
- Languages at some commands
- If bored try to "fix" the 3 excluded from booru
- Find a way for music to not start at 100 at every song

__**To test:**__
- Test guildMemberAdd role
- Why is there an empty space at guildMemberAdd
- Check if phub has temporary or longer error
