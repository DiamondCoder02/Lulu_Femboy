4th trying making a Discorcd bot.
Please don't use this...(, **unless you know what mess I made here.**)
#### A bit of explanation:
Just my own little bot to learn. Early in development. Still not stupid proof but working on it as I don't want it to break often.
Feel free to contribute if you want. I also appriciate every problem report and every help.
This bot only works with slash commands. NSFW commands only works in nsfw channels. :3
## Setup
- Have latest [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- First start setup.bat (You can close the console when done).
- Make a bot for yourself at [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Get both Client ID and Token, copy and paste into the config.json file.
- (Temporarly you need to have a channel id where it can send one message where it sends a ready message.)
- If you want you can change the stop password for your desire but it's only used for the stop command( for now).
- You can select a language with writing the filename you want from the language folder( without the file extension / .json)
- Invite the bot into the server with this link. Replace TEXT with client id: ( https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=TEXT&permissions=2415930432&scope=bot%20applications.commands )
- After all this save and run start.bat

"Easy" language support as usual. In config you can kinda see what I plan and how I'm currently holding.

### Future (maybe) ideas:
- [ ] Even more 18+ 
- [ ] reminder
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Better role handling
- [ ] More event listeners
### Currently I know broken or needs a bit of fixing:
- [ ] Better error handling for things 
- [ ] Weird behaviour sometimes at nHentai when collector gets a stroke 
- [ ] nHentai also fucky wucky with dms
- [x] Translation finally works. ~~Not sure but I will find a working translation package that I can use for the translation command~~
