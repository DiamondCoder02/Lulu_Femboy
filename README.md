## REMAKE PUG TO HTML, FUCK PUGS

Also rewrite everything to my own liking, not following a tutorial

## A bit of explanation

Hi and welcome to the bots development page. Currently I work alone while doing university, so development is slow. Hope you enjoy the bot and have fun with it.
The development can be checked on the [projects page](https://github.com/users/DiamondCoder02/projects/2).

This is a multi purpose bot, but the main focus is on the wholesome side. So no nsfw unless you want. Of course the lewd bot can be found here: [Lily_Femboy nsfw](https://github.com/DiamondCoder02/Lily_Femboy).

As a special feature if both bot is in one server, the two bot might talk with each other, but I will see how hard would it be to implement it.

### Debug level for dotenv

(*-1 will disappear all logging.*)

0. Only errors.
1. Console.warn and line (line is not shown in log file)
2. Console.info
3. Console.log (Default)
4. Console.debug
5. (Enable shard logs, but probably spam the console/logs)

console.log("foo"); // Logged to console & saved in 1594897100267.log \
console.debug("foo"); // Won't log to console, but will be saved in 1594897100267.log

## Notes

- .env only gives back string.
- Drink wine and listen to music, to boost morale, motivational and productivity.
- Never stay with parents more than a week. It's harder to work.
